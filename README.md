Hi 👋, My name is Gautam Sharma and I love solving technical problems and sharing my knowledge with others. I quickly get overwhelmed and looking for ways to do more in less time.

I’m having more than 16 years of experience in the IT industry, with deep knowledge in products from leading technology companies such as Microsoft (including Intune, EXO, Teams, and Entra ID), Omnissa (Workspace ONE), OKTA, Quest, and others. My current focus is on consulting, implementing, migrating, upgrading, and integrating tools and technologies into the modern workplace to enhance user experience while keeping security and stability. 

### Innovation: 
Developed an automated tool for ***tenant-to-tenant Windows Device Migration***, to streamline, simplify the migration process, making it more efficient and user-friendly, reducing the time and effort required for migrations.

***Developed an Office 365 assessment tool***: To generate a comprehensive document that contains information about Office 365 global configurations, Azure Active Directory, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Teams configurations
