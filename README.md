### Hi, My name is Gautam Sharma and I love solving technical problems and sharing my knowledge with others. I quickly get overwhelmed and looking for ways to do more in less time.
I'm a 13+ year veteran of IT and experienced on multiple products from Microsoft, Google, Symantec, Good, Blackberry, Quest, etc. My current focus is on design and implementation and integrate new product/technology with existing infra, providing solution on for Migration, up-gradation and green field setup, but not limited to, on Identity, Messaging, Microsoft 365, Mobility, and Azure. 
As Iâ€™m mostly working with Microsoft systems, PowerShell quickly became my scripting language of choice. By doing more I slowly felt more confident to share my code and solutions with others.
